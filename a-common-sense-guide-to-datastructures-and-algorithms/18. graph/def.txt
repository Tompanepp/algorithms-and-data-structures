What is it?
    datastructure that specialise in relationships
    types:
        directed => one directional relationships
        non-directed => mutual relationships
        
Concepts related to it:
    vertex = node
    edge = line that represents the relationships between nodes
        - directional
        - non directional/unidirectional
    
    
    adjacent vertices = vertices connected by an edge

Performance Analysis:
    How fast is it to peform the operation? (i.e. Time Complexity)
        => Measured in terms of the number of steps it takes to complete the operation
