# algorithms-and-data-structures

algorithm = sequence of steps on data to produce a result.
datatructure = organisation of data.

The objctive of this repository is build from stratch the stack of classic data structures and algorithms using the C programming language.

This is for education purposes as I unpack this layer computation.

# how to use
navigate to datastructure's folder
navigate into test folder
run make

e.g. building the array datastructure

```
    cd 2.array
```
```
    cd test
```
```
    make
```
runs the test program and prints results to cli
```
    ./test-program 
```

unit test
