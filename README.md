# algorithms-and-data-structures

algorithms = sequence of steps on data to produce a result.
datatructure = organisation of data.

The objctive of this repository is build from stratch the stack of classic data structures and algorithms using the C programming language.  

This is for education purposes as I unpack this layer computation.
